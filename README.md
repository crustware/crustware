# ABOUT ME

 ## VRChat junkie
 make avatar edits some prefabs and help others assemble there avi's
 
 ## Linux Desktop Ricer 
 i've posted my personal rice as its most basic broken form
 for the most part i love tiling window managers mostly for being able to have or split windows across a large workspace
 Linux is a great operating system for respecting your freedom to do with your machines as you see fit and have them behave the way you want them too. putting in that elbow grease is a fun distraction when i have time on my hands 
 
 ## Cringe Edgy Boyo from 2008
graduated from schooling in 2008 and never went back
i wanted to go to school and do interface and ui design but never went
anything i've ever learned is from googling it and wasting my time tinkering with shit
i guess i learned this habit being curious and having no internet for which to better entertain myself growing up
shame that is apparently its like the golden age of the internet or something. 
the first time i got a stable connection was in 2011
